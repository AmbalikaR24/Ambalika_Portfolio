**L07_AmbalikaRajendran_ITAI1378.ipynb** **- Code-Driven Object Classification Showdown.**
This notebook encapsulates the project 'Code-Driven Object Classification Showdown', providing a hands-on experience in building and evaluating an object classification model. It not only reinforced fundamental concepts in machine learning but also fostered a deeper understanding of the iterative and nuanced nature of model development. Reflecting on the challenges, decisions, and learnings throughout the process enriched my knowledge and prepared me for future endeavors in machine learning and data science.

Through a systematic experimentation process involving architectural changes, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization techniques, the image classification model achieved significant performance improvements. These enhancements not only increased accuracy but also enhanced the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Continuous refinement and fine-tuning are essential for further improving the model's performance and adapting it to different tasks or datasets.

This project provided valuable insights into real-world object recognition tasks. Throughout the project, we encountered challenges such as overfitting, hyperparameter tuning, and selecting appropriate architectures. We addressed these challenges by employing regularization techniques, adjusting learning rates, and utilizing pre-trained models. Our experiments showed that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 outperformed our modified VGG-style CNN. However, we observed variations in the mean probability of certain classes in predictions. Through experimentation and iterative improvement, we developed models with competitive performance on the CIFAR-100 dataset. These experiences have equipped us with a deeper understanding of CNNs and transfer learning, enriching our skill set for future projects in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
